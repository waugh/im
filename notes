Every object has a copyable, testable surface manifestation?
An object's structure can be tested for?
In this case, teller can be a distinct structure.
An argument might not at a time know its structure, but it's guaranteed to
only ever have at most one, and the structure is copyable.
Noncopyable flows are hidden in something?

Define most primitives as expressions rather than commands?

First argument of a command is always a teller for a result? Not if there is an
