This is not a shell script.  It is a collection of snippets that you might want
to run, straight or modified, or not at all, as you judge apprpriate.

This project uses node.js.  I'm testing this project in a user account set up to
use nvm (Node Version Manager).  Below are approximately the commands to set
that up.


user=jack
n=$HOME/n # 'n' means Not worth backing up.
# An 'e' command runs my favorite editor.
cd $n/projects/personal
ls nvm
ls -dl $HOME/.nvm
git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git
ln -s ../../n/$user/projects/personal/nvm $HOME/.nvm
# The above relative symbolic link assumes /home is /mnt/big/home and that
# $n resolves to /mnt/big/n/jack .  Modify as needed for your environment.
cd nvm
git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`

e $HOME/.bashrc # make sure it contains:

. $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh
