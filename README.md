# im -- Programming Language "Imperatrix Mundi"

I am trying to invent a programming language with these broad characteristics:

- suitability for transparent persistence;
- concurrent-constraint logic;
- lazy evaluation;
- referential transparency;
- suitability for programming browsers as well as web servers.

The implementation for browsers might not handle persistency.
